title: Markdown and HTML

Jekyll supports the use of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) with inline HTML tags which makes it easier to quickly write posts with Jekyll, without having to worry too much about text formatting. A sample of the formatting follows.

Tables have also been extended from Markdown:

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

Highlighting for code in Jekyll is done using Pygments or Rouge. This theme makes use of Rouge by default.

```cpp
// count to ten
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

// count to twenty
var j = 0;
while (j < 20) {
    j++;
    console.log(j);
}
```

Type Theme uses KaTeX to display maths. Equations such as $$S_n = a \times \frac{1-r^n}{1-r}$$ can be displayed inline.

Alternatively, they can be shown on a new line:

$$ f(x) = \int \frac{2x^2+4x+6}{x-2} $$
